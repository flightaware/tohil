you have to build without stubs to create a .so/.dylib that python likes

turn off stubs in configure.in

change -ltclstub86 to -ltcl86 in Makefile -- this needs to be done properly

"python3 setup.tcl build" builds a shared library but it's no good

"sudo python3 setup.tcl install" installs it and the tooling for "import tclpy" to work.

but if you copy the shared library that make makes into the place that the setup.py installer thing uses, import tclpy works from python3

something like (on the mac, using pyenv)

sudo cp libtclpy0.5.0.dylib ~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tclpy.cpython-38-darwin.so

cp libtclpy0.5.0.dylib build/lib.macosx-10.6-x86_64-3.8/tclpy.cpython-38-darwin.so



from python:


>>> import tclpy
>>> tclpy.eval('set a(99) goof')
'goof'
>>> tclpy.eval('set a(5) foo')
'foo'
>>> tclpy.getvar('a','99')
'goof'
>>> tclpy.getvar(array='a',var='5')
'foo'
>>> tclpy.getvar(array='a',var='16')
>>>


new subst method

>>> import tclpy
>>> tclpy.eval("set name karl")
'karl'
>>> tclpy.subst("hello, $name")
'hello, karl'



>>> tclpy.expr('5+5')
'10'
>>> tclpy.expr('5**5')
'3125'
>>> tclpy.expr('1/3')
'0'
>>> tclpy.expr('1/3.')
1
>>> tclpy.expr('[clock seconds] % 86400')
'25571'


>>> tclpy.eval('set a "a 1 b 2 c 3"')
'a 1 b 2 c 3'
>>> tclpy.subst("$a")
'a 1 b 2 c 3'
>>> tclpy.eval('return $a')
'a 1 b 2 c 3'
>>> tclpy.megaval('return $a','list')
['a', '1', 'b', '2', 'c', '3']
>>> tclpy.megaval('return $a','dict')
{'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}


>>> tclpy.megaval(to="list",tcl_code="return [list 1 2 3 4]")
['1', '2', '3', '4']

check this out, converting expected results to python datatypes:

>>> import tclpy
>>> tclpy.megaval("clock seconds")
'1616053828'
>>> tclpy.megaval("clock seconds",to="int")
1616053834
>>> tclpy.megaval("clock seconds",to="float")
1616053838.0
>>> tclpy.megaval("clock seconds",to="bool")
True
>>> tclpy.megaval("clock seconds",to="list")
['1616053849']

don't forget you're doing

    python3 setup.py build
    sudo python3 setup.py install

when building and installing the python module

now megaval with to='set' option to return a set from a list

>>> tclpy.megaval('return [list 1 2 3 4 4 3]',to='set')
{'3', '4', '2', '1'}

TODO

make tclpy.expr able to do the to= stuff that tclpy.megaval can do.

get rid of tclpy.eval and rename tclpy.megaval to tclpy.eval

intercept stdout when exec'ing python in rivet and pump it to rivet





### what wizardry is this

how about a python object that wraps a tcl object and can do things with it

it would need to be implemented in C

it would be able to get the object as a string, an int, a float, a list, etc, if it can be represented that way.

for example if you try to do list stuff with it it'll do a Tcl_GetListFromObj and if it returns an error it'll throw an exception.



### tcl dict walk

tcl dict walks are done with Tcl_DictObjFirst, Tcl_DictObjNext and Tcl_DictObjDone.

when we implement iterators on dicts, we'll use those in the iterator function that we return for the iterator.

### ideas

look at tcl errorCode in tohil_python_return to set the python error code

hmm pass the tcl error code as part of an exception object, as a python list

maybe make a specific tcldict object so it can have all the tricked out iter semantics and stuff.  can it inherit from the tclobj object?  i bet it can

make a .td_lappend and .td_incr that don't suck.

make a .incr

maybe have a shadow variable as well as shadow arrays, a way for tclobj to shadow a variable or an array element, or maybe a subclass, the tclobj is fetched from the variable or element at the start of the operation and stored at the end

this solves the sort of surprising behavior of tclobjs that when you get from a var and change it, it doesn't change the var

### templates?

possibly inspect tcl procs using "info args" and "info default" to figure out what arguments they expect and generate a python trampoline that lets you invoke with python style named arguments, etc,

### trampoline stuff

import tohil
from tohil import procster
tohil.procster.package_require("Tclx")
defs = procster.procs.probe_procs()
exec(defs)

make the wrappers import into a namespace?

make them define methods in a class?

done, that's exactly what we do now.

if tohil.call or tohil.eval or tohil.exec get a tcl error, instead of throwing RuntimeError have them throw a new TclError object that will include the errorCode, errorInfo, error frame, etc, from tcl.

Done, python TclError class, instantiated from C with a tclobj as the argument to the innit routine.

scrape the comment headers of the procs to create the docstrings for the tohil stuff


### tohil for people with big tcl code bases who want to use python and not rewrite everything


### stuff

look at https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/_tkinter.c_

a dict, a list, a canal, panama

right now a tclobj or tcldict returns data types it has been configured to return, or a default type of string.

if it's a nest of dicts and you're pulling a chunk of dict stuff out, you want a tcldict

but if it's something terminal in the tree, you don't want a dict, you want the value

if you try to get it as a dict it'll be an error

it's considered unsafe practice to examine tcl's objects to see what data type they are, and it
is unsafe because they can have the correct format that they will be the structure of a list or
dict or whatever, but they haven't been parsed into one so their type is string or whatever.

or it could be a list if looked at as a list but still also be a dict.  dicts will parse as lists.

need an equivalent to ShadowDicts for scalar variables in tcl

the problem is if it's a class then you don't have any keen assignment
syntax, unlike with shadow dicts; you're going to have to invoke a function
because if you say `foo = tohil.ShadowVar("foo")` that's good but you can't
say `foo = 'bar'` to assign to it because that'll create a new foo.

you'll have to do like foo.set('bar'), which is a bit annoying.

also the class can be callable so you could get it with foo()

and it could reconigze it was called with an argument and could set from that



analysis = tohil.ShadowVar("analysis")

analysis.set(analysis() + 'foo')

wish we could say analysis += message

that's not too hard actually

we could even make tclobj's += look at the argument and if it's a string use
concatenation, although we might ought to look at that string as a number,
we do now, and just stick with that, i don't know.

we've got these tclobjs and they're pretty handy already.  maybe the trick
is to provide a way to bind a tclobj to a tcl variable so that when read it
reattaches the tclobj to the var if it doesn't exactly point at it

and after stores a Tcl_ObjSetVar2, or whatever, to keep the var synced
with the object.

analysis = tohil.tclobj(var="analysis")

we already have t.setvar() and t.getvar() to manually sync

subinterpreter support

tohil should now (5/16/21) support subinterpreters insofar as it should
be doing multiphase init properly.

the question now is how do we put it to work

and in particular solve the problem when running rivet with separate
virtual (tcl) interpreter

the rivet problem is that when running separate virtual interpreters there
are multiple tcl interpreters.

if one does a package require tohil, it gets pretty hooked into python,
some other one comes along and does a package require tohil, the stuff it
tries to do with python is shared and the stuff python does with tcl is
done with the original tcl interpreter, which is not what we want, and often
will be an error because the other interpreter is not being used to generating
a webpage, while the one using python is.  and that's how you'll get errors
like that you invoked something while not generating a page.

when running separate virtual interpreters, each tcl interpreter that tries
to use python should get its own python subinterpreter.  this will allow
the devs to have their own variant python code and to prevent weird crosstalk
between the interpreters.

how python hooks into tcl is by importing tohil.  how tohil finds the tcl
interpreter to hook into is it either creates it if python is the parent
or accesses it if tcl is the parent.

for rivet, tcl is always the parent.  at least currently unless we start
running mod_python or something.

so if under separate virtual interpreters a tcl interpreter does a package
require tohil, i think we would need to create a python subinterpreter,
at least for the second tcl interpreter requiring tohil within a single
httpd process, and somehow whenever that tcl interpreter tried to do
anything with python, it would PyThreadState_Swap() to switch to its
subinterpreter, if it wasn't already on it.

one approach might be to use Tcl_SetAssocData to store the thread state
returned by Py_NewInterpreter() in the Tcl interpreter.

then when our tcl functions are called, we can do a PyThreadState_Swap()

you could test and practice with interpreters returned by interp create,
run interp eval on them and do package require tohil and see if you
get subinterpreters like you expect.

check python source for how cool python is for switching a thread state
to whatever it already is, should just return.

experiments seem promising however we are creating them when we don't
need them and it is breaking tests.

i think ideally you want to create your first subinterpreter for your
second tcl interpreter that package requires tohil within a process,
and keep creating subinterpreters from there on.

so you need a mechanism to spot that second tcl interpreter

you'd need to store it somewhere reliable but not off of a global

ok, this led to an acceptable answer.  when python is the parent,
it sets the tcl interpreter that it creates, it sets its python interpreter
using the set assoc data thing in tcl to be the associated python
interpreter to this tcl interpreter.

if tcl is the parent and the python interpreter hasn't already been
initialized, tohil initializes it and sets the main python interpreter
using the set assoc data thing.

if tcl is the parent and the python interpreter has already been initialized
and the current tcl interpreter doesn't have a python interpreter set,
tohil uses Py_NewInterpreter() to create a ne3w interpreter and associate
it with the current tcl interpreter.

-----

trying to understand why call can't find builtins

well, tohil::eval and tohil::exec use PyRun_StringFlags.

The logic in TohilCall_Cmd for finding the callable python object to run
doesn't completely work right, compared to PyRun_StringFlags.

PyRun_StringFlags is in cpython/Python/pythonrun.c.  It uses python internal
functions _PyUnicode_FromId, _PyParser_ASTFromString, _PyArena_New, _PyArena_Free.

I think PyParser_ASTFromString and run_mod are the things of interest.



./configure --prefix=/opt/local --exec-prefix=/opt/local --with-python-version=3.9 --with-tcl=/usr/lib --enable-symbols
./configure --prefix=/opt/local --exec-prefix=/opt/local --with-python-version=3.9 --with-tcl=/opt/local/lib --enable-symbols



python3 setup.py build --debug --force
sudo /opt/local/bin/python3 install --prefix=/opt/local

hey guess what, sudo changes the PATH, say you have /opt/local/bin first in your path, sudo
gives you a real chopped-down path, so sudo python3 may give you /usr/bin/python3 even though
python3 gives you /opt/local/bin/python3

so say which version of python3 you want, explicitly

this is probably why forcing the prefix screwed things up previously

sudo /opt/local/bin/python3 setup.py install

^ did this magically put it in the right place

also not just gdb tclsh but gdb tclsh8.6 or make sure you're getting the right tclsh

---

run_eval_code_obj at line 1240 in pythonrun.c

line 1212 /* Set globals['__builtins__'] if it doesn't exist */ is interesting

but to get here it had to compile stuff, hopefully stepping PyEval_EvalCodeEx
will lead us to understanding.

_PyEval_EvalCode is getting closer
