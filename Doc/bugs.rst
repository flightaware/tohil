*****************
Dealing with Bugs
*****************

Python and Tcl are both mature programming language which have
well-earned reputations for
stability, reliability and correct behavior, Tohil, while maturing rapidly,
is still fairly new,
and is more likely to have bugs and/or memory leaks.

In order to bring tohil to a high level of reliability,
the Tohil developers would like to
know of any deficiencies you find in it.

If you come across a bug, have an idea for a feature, etc,
please use
`Tohil's issue tracker <https://github.com/flightaware/tohil/issues>`_
to get in touch with us.

For appropriately skilled developers it can be sometimes faster
(and scratch an itch) to
fix bugs yourself and contribute patches to
Tohil. This can be done through https://github.com/flightaware/tohil.

==================
Documentation bugs
==================

If you find a bug in this documentation or would like to propose an improvement,
please submit a bug report on aforelinked github site.  If you
have a suggestion on how to fix it, please include that as well.

.. _contributing-to-tohil:

===============================================
Getting started contributing to Tohil yourself
===============================================

Beyond just reporting bugs that you find, you are also welcome to submit
patches to fix them.  We will review pull requests and work with you to
get yours accepted, or something satisfactory, as long as what you are
trying to do is reasonably aligned with how we think tohil should work.

You can always fork it if you want to go off on your own direction.
