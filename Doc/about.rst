About these documents
=====================


These Tohil documents, like Python's documentation, are generated 
from `reStructuredText`_ sources by `Sphinx`_, a
document processor specifically written for the Python documentationt

.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/

Tohil is a volunteer effort, just like Python and Tcl.  If you want to contribute, please take a
look at the :ref:`reporting-bugs` page for information on how to do so.  New
volunteers are always welcome!
