Tohil Tcl Errors
================

If Python code invoked from Tcl using Tohil results in 
Python exception that is not trapped by any of the Python code, Tohil
will trap the exception, translate it into a Tcl error, and propagate
the error back through Tcl.

If Tcl is being used interactively and the error isn't caught, it will
make its way to an error reported in the interactive session.

Likewise if the Tcl error propagates all the way back to tohil due to
Tcl code having been called from Python, the Tcl error will be propagated
as a Python exception, see :ref:_tohil-exceptions.

The Tcl stack trace will include the Python stack trace of the Python
code that was executing at the time of the exception being raised.

The Tcl error code, often referred to as the Tcl global *errorCode*,
but also accessible via a Tcl dict created via an argument to
Tcl's *catch* or *try*

Tcl's errorCode represents additional information about an error in the form
of a Tcl list that is intended to be easy easy to process with programs, unlike,
for instance, error messages, which may be localized into different languages
and be difficult to interpret reliably using a program.

The first element of the errorCode
list identifies a general class of errors.  For Tcl errors generated by
Tohil in response to uncaught Python exceptions, the first element of
errorCode is set to `PYTHON`.

The next element is the Python class name of the exception, followed
by the base error message.

    >>> tohil.interact()
    % tohil::exec missing_function
    name 'missing_function' is not defined
    while evaluating tohil::exec missing_function
    % puts $errorCode
    PYTHON NameError {name 'missing_function' is not defined}
    % puts $errorInfo
    name 'missing_function' is not defined
    from python code executed by tohil  File "tohil", line 1, in <module>
        invoked from within
    "tohil::exec missing_function"
        ("eval" body line 1)
        invoked from within
    "eval $::tclreadline::LINE"


Here is another sample Tcl session catching an uncaught Python exception as a
Tcl error, where the errorCode is set into the catch options var:

   >>>
   $ tclsh
   % package require tohil
   3.2.0
   % catch {tohil::eval "no"} catchResult catchDict
   1
   % puts $catchResult
   name 'no' is not defined
   % puts [dict get $catchDict -errorcode]
   PYTHON NameError {name 'no' is not defined}

   % puts $catchDict
   -code 1 -level 0 -errorstack {INNER {invokeStk1 tohil::eval no} UP 1} -errorcode {PYTHON NameError {name 'no' is not defined}} -errorinfo {name 'no' is not defined
   from python code executed by tohil  File "tohil", line 1, in <module>
   invoked from within
   "tohil::eval "no""} -errorline 1
