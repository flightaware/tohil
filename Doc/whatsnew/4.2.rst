  What's New In Tohil 4.2
****************************

Welcome to Tohil 4.2.

4.2 is primarily a maintenance release, but includes at least one really
nice new feature:

===================================================================================
Python code passed to tohil::exec is now unindented before being passed to Python
===================================================================================

Tohil's #1 new feature request!  Up until now, the argument to ``tohil::exec``
had to obey Python indentation rules including there being no indentation at all
for the top level, leading to ugly stuff like:

::

        tohil::exec {
    def new_validate(self, data):
         return json.loads(base64.b64decode(data))
        }

^ The "def" here has to occur at the beginning of the line, i.e. not be preceded
by any spaces or
tabs, or Python will raise an exception.  This nesting does not "read" well.

To make it easier to make your code read well and comply with Python indentation rules,
if the first nonblank line starts with whitespace, tohil::exec will un-indent the code block
such that the first line is not indented at all and following lines are undented
to match, all done lickety split, natively in C.

So you can now nest your embedded Python code in a more standard way:

::

    tohil::exec {
       def new_validate(self, data):
            return json.loads(base64.b64decode(data))
    }

=======================================
Additional Improvements
=======================================

* Added ``-nonevalue`` option to ``tohil::call``, allowing the "none" sentinel
  to be specified arbitrarily (Retains the default value of ``tohil::NONE``.)
* Cleaned up tohil namespace so ``dir(tohil)`` doesn't show modules tohil imported as
  if it had created them.
* Made ``package forget tohil`` work.
* Added support for the Tcl ``unload`` command to be able to unload the Tohil shared
  library. (Consider it risky, though.)

========================================
Bug Fixes
========================================

* Fixed crash when register_callback-registered functions raised a Python exception

=====================================
Improved Build Support
=====================================

* Added support for building tohil as a Debian package
* Homebrew formula for building with homebrew
